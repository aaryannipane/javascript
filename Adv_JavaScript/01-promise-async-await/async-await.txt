ASYNC AND AWAIT

async - This keyword is used to tun a function declaration to asyne function.

asyne Function - An asyne function is a function declared with the async keyword.
An async function is a function that knows how to expect the possibility of the await
keyword being used to invoke asynchronous code. It returns a Promise.

await - The await operator is used to wait for a Promise. It can only be used inside
an async function within regular JavaScript code.
await can be put in front of any async promise-based function to pause your code on
that line until the promise fulfills, then return the resulting value.
