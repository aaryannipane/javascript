// ARRAYS : two ways to declare an array
// 1- using []
var lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// 2- using generic array type: Array<elemType>
var ist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// typescript comes with readOnlyArray<T> type that is the same as Array<T> with all mutating methods removed, so you can make sure you don't change the array after creation
var rolst = lst;
// we now can't modify this array cause it is read only
// rolst[0] = 12; //error
// rolst.push(10); //error
// rolst.length = 100; //error
// lst1 = rolst; //error
// TUPLES
// tuple type allow you to express an array where the type of fixed number of elements is known but need not be the same.
// for example you may want to represent a value as a pair of a string and a number:
// declare a  tuple type
var x;
// initialize it 
x = ["hello", 10]; // OK 
// initialize it incorrectly
// x = [10, "hello"]; // error, cause string should be before number
// ENUM - enum is collection of named constant

console.log(c);
// ANY - A variable with this type can have it's value set to a string, number, or anything else
var notSure = 10;
notSure = "Hello"; // we can keep string too in any dataType
// NULL and UNDEFINED 
// By default null and undefined are subtypes of all other types. That means you can assign null and undefined to something like number.
// In TypeScript 2.0, null and undefined have their own types which allows developers to explicitly express when null/undefined values are acceptable.
// Now, when something can be either a number or null, you can describe it with the union type number | null (which reads as "number or null")
var v1;
console.log(v1); // undefined
v1 = null;
// void - used with function that don't return any value
function warnUser() {
    console.log('Warning');
}
// TYPE INFERENCE
// if datatype of variable is not provided, its type will be infered on based on RHS expression type
var msg = 10; // now msg variable is infered as number
// msg = "hey" // error cause msg is infered as number 
// TYPE CASTING
var a = 10;
// method 1
var ten = a; // a casted to string from any 
// method 2
ten = a;
// FOR .. OF and FOR .. IN
// Both for..of and for..in statements iterate over lists; the values iterated on are diferent though, for..in returns a list of keys on the object being iterated, whereas for..of returns a list of values of the numeric properties of the object being iterated.
// In TypeScript/JavaScript objects have internal properties with themselves. One of the property is [[Enumerable]]. If [[Enumerable]] is set to true it will iterate through object properties only rather through the items or elements.
// For.of is a new way for iterating collections. IÅ¥'s introduced in ES6. Earlier you had to use for or while loop to iterate through elements of a collection. For for..of to work on an collection, the collection must have an [Symbol.iterator] property.
